Who makes coffee today website

V1 - Who will be brewing coffee for us today? Let's randomly choose one from the crew. V2 - Again a nasty looking kitchen-sink at the office? Whos turn would it be to clean the dishes. Lets use a random generator to point out a winner for the tasks. The site has also a more deeper meening as it also presents briefly the randomly chosen "selected" person with a picture and comment. The demo contetn consists of 9 IT legends who will brew your coffee.

Development suggestions and discussion can be posted here:
- What if the images and text could be posted to a server when adding yourself to the list. As the data of the participants would be placed on the server it would fetched with GET command from the server and the randomizer function would be there and send the data.
