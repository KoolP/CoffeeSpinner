# CoffeeSpinner
This app is made to introduce people to one another, the play is also dedicated to the equal division of household chores. The idea to this tool started from the problem that is present at many workplaces. Every company has them everyday heroes "Sheldons" who fills the dishwasher, puts on some coffee and takes care, while others are not that natural in pursuing equality or the company culture is lacking in policy of household rules. A fact for many organizations is that if you would divide equally the chores between people involved it many times shows that the amount of times putting dishes in the dishwasher, cooking coffee, taking the garbage out etc. would not be that hard to manage. This app could also be a threat to the whole cleaning industry and why not pursue towards a more equal society where some need to clean up the dirt of others. Not speaking about equal rights at home. Welcome to develop and synergize! :)

NOTES:
Version 1 - Who will be brewing coffee for us today? Let's randomly choose one from the crew.
Version 2 (branch: dishwashing) - Again a nasty looking kitchen-sink at the office? Whom turn would it be to clean the dishes. Lets use a random generator to point out a winner for the tasks.

Development suggestions and discussion can be posted here:
- What if the images and text could be posted to a server when adding yourself to the list. As the data of the participants would be placed on the server it would fetched with GET command from the server and the randomizer function would be there and send the data.
