# CoffeeSpinner
The idea to this tool is from the problem that is present at many workplaces and households. Every company has them everyday heroes "Sheldons" who fills and empties the dishwasher, puts on some coffee, loves household chores, while others are not that natural in pursuing equality or simply the company or home culture is lacking in policy for the household chores. A fact for many organizations and homes is that if you would divide equally the chores between people involved, it many times shows that the amount of times putting dishes in the dishwasher, cooking coffee, taking the garbage out etc. would not be that hard to manage, just divide the days and people to find out how often you need to do it at your office. This app is most definitely also a threat to the whole cleaning industry, lets clean our own dirt, lets have equal rights at home and let the solidarity make a great atmosphere at the offices. The added value of this tool is also to introduce the persons who are participating in the game. Welcome to develop and synergize! :)

Teach specs: html,css,javascript, jquery, SPA (single page application)


APPENDIX NOTES:
Version 1 - Who will be brewing coffee for us today? Let's randomly choose one from the crew.
Version 2 (branch: dishwashing) - Again a nasty looking kitchen-sink at the office? Whom turn would it be to clean the dishes. Lets use a random generator to point out a winner for the tasks.

Development ideas:
- What if the participant/user images and text could be posted to a server when a user could add herself to the list. As the data of the participants would be placed on the server it would fetched from the server.
